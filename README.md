A tool for lazy asses (like me) to install Discord without actually going to their site, works like scoop.sh (only supports Windows for now)
How to install?

`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`

`Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://micheal-lolz.github.io/discoop/discord.ps1" | Invoke-Expression`
